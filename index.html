 				I was always a happy child in my childhood. I loved to play bicycle as much as I loved to dance. I was very young when my grandfather died. Whenever I see his pictures, I become very emotional. I was always this shy, timid girl who had anxiety while speaking infront of puvblic. This has continued all my life and I am still an introvert. I have participated in competitions as well but due to my anxiety now I feel like I would have done better. Nevertheless, It was a very fun experience. Our school took us to a trip to India and honestly, it was the best trip. I made a lot of memories there.

    				<p> <b>Cooking Skills </b>: As pandemic has affected the whole world and most of it are still in lockdown, I have started to look into the internet and follow a recipe for cooking. I had started in the first lockdown itself and now I am improving my culinary skills.</p> 

    				<p> <b>Teaching Assistant</b>: I have worked as a teaching assistant this lockdown. I mananged to learn a lot from it like organising skills and develop a will to teach the students.</p>
    				
    				<p><b> Basic Programming Skills</b>: Since grade 4/5, our school had taught us computer. Even in my +2 level, I took computer. So because of this, I have basic knowledge of python, php, html and css.</p>

			<p class="last"> When I was in the school, my particpation in activities were very low. I would get anxiety talking in front of a mass. However, I did earn some certificates of participation as well as of coming in top 3 for poem competition in grade 6. When I came to deerwalk, I participated in debate competitions, poem competions, futsal and badminton. I managed to earn some some certificates and medals. Just a few weeks back, I helped one of my teacher as a teaching assitant for which I will be receiving a letter and some money. I have also done few courses in coursera as well. I have written articles in +2 whose liink will be provided down below.</p>
